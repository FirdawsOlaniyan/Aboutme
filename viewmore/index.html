    My name is <b><u>Firdaws Oyinkansola Olaniyan</u></b>
    I love reading and writing and I am also obsessed with helping people they really help me out when  I  am stressed my mum always says that
    I  should not sacrifice myself for others but  I  think  I  am used to it, it might have negative sides but  I  am fine with it so far  I  help people out.
    My best subject is biology the sight of blood and human body facinates me. I dont have a best friend the thought
    of commiting to a friend when others commit to me makes me feel guilty so  I rather not have one to be even.
<p>When I was young I always dreamt of becoming a doctor I  don't know why but the idea of being in the ward helping people facinates me
        at first my parents thought it was just a dream like every other child but that was not my case when I  got to JSS3 my father wanted me to be a
        pharmacist or an engineer, he thought it would be good for a female because I would have time for my family but I did not like it,
         all I wanted was to be in the ward helping people I want to help humanity. I had a plan that i would have my hospital like that
        i would still have time for my family. when my mum was pregnant with my youngest brother and they told me there was few female gynecologist I was suprised and then I decided that was what I wanted
        because most women wants a female doctor but then there is not enough so that motivated me. Then my cousin died of cancer I was sad but then I 
        had a dream that I would try my best to get the cure for cancer iI might not do it alone but I would try my best to make sure chidren and families do not go
        through the same thing.
</p>
<p>Well presently I am a writer, I write poems my pen name is innocentie,I don't know I am not an art student but I just love writing it is my talent I want to 
    reach the world just by writing I also code I am learning HTML and CSS with python I just feel it is a skill you need to learn in this 21st century.
I am someone who loves being who I am, I am an ambivert I behave according to where I am I hate pretenders because I feel be who you are no matter what happens
I don't decieve I rather tell you how it is people say it is being savage or rude sometimes but I just treat people the way I would love to be treated, because 
I know how it feels to be treated bad I have been through it all and then there is something I really support and that is love yourself no matter what you might 
not be as perfect as others, but nobody is everybody has something special in them and it is just for you to realize when to make you shine. </p>
<p>All I ever want is just for me to help my people and country I won't say we are lagging but then we really are we are smart people but we need to realize it we are not lazy we just
    need that push and then that is it. I am in support of anybody that is doing their best to change it I want to be a doctor to help but I also want to have an NGO just to help too.
    I want to have free classes just to teach people, my first class is starting August 2022 where i will teach people how to write poems. I want to start with 30 students to see how 
    it goes. If there is one thing i have learnt from life is that, <em>No matter what it throws at you just be happy and embrace it because nothing would happen without
    Gods knowledge and my advice to people is that no matter what just keep trying because you can do it and no child is dull we just need the motivation and the right people around us.</em>
